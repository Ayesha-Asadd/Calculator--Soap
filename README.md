# 🧮 Calculator SOAP API

Basic Arithmetic Operations via WSDL – A Practical SOAP Web Service Integration

---

## 📖 About The Project

**Calculator SOAP API Integration** is a simple yet powerful example demonstrating how to **consume a WSDL-based SOAP web service** to perform **basic arithmetic operations** – Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Using the **[Calculator SOAP Web Service](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL)**, this project teaches:

- How to **construct SOAP requests**  
- How to **parse XML responses**  
- How to create a **JavaScript-based SOAP client**  
- How to integrate SOAP APIs into a **responsive front-end UI**  

Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it’s a beginner-friendly and SEO-optimized project for anyone learning **SOAP API integration**.
